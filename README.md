Godot Port of HeartBeast's Ludum Dare 33 submission.

I have seen HeartBeast's sidescroller tutorial on YouTube and decided to go along and rebuild what he shows in Gamemaker, in the Godot Engine. All assets are HeartBeast's intellectual property. All code within this repo that are not part of the Godot Engine, are my intellectual property. This is an exercise and is not meant to be copied, distributed or commercially used.
